## Student Career Goal Statement

In five years I hope to open my own company that deals with AI in regards to individuals or companies finances. The AI would collect data for their finances and be able to project earnings or deficits based on their financial trends.
ith using the AI Iâ€™d be able to help the individuals/companies be able to look into the potential future and see where they would be if they keep up their current trends and be able to provide insight on how they can change to be able to reach their financial goals.
